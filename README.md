# ConwaysGameOfLifeBlazorWASM

Just a small project to learn some Blazor. Moreover I always wanted to code Conway's Game of Live. So here's my try.
Play with it here: https://jheinath.github.io/ConwaysGameOfLifeBlazorWASM/

There will be more features added to the project soon:
- Reset button
- Variable size
- templates
